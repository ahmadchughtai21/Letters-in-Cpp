# Lab Task 2
 My Name's First and Last Letters in C++


Description:
This C++ program brings a personal touch to ASCII art by showcasing two letters, "A" and "D," which represent the first and last letters of the name "Ahmad." The code utilizes the standard C++ library and includes the "iostream" header to display this customized design in the console. The "A" and "D" are beautifully formed using dollar signs, creating an artistic representation. To enhance the aesthetic appeal, the code adjusts the console text and background color to a visually pleasing combination of black (0) and light green (B).

Instructions:

Compile and run this code within your C++ development environment.
Observe the artistic depiction of the letters "A" and "D" created with dollar signs.
Enjoy the color scheme of black and light green, which adds a personalized and visually appealing touch to the ASCII art.
Feel free to adapt the code to represent different letters or names, experimenting with various characters and color combinations to create your unique and personalized ASCII art using C++
